Polling - Each poll makes a statement and keeps a tally of how many more times "yes" has been selected than "no".  A positive 
score means yes has been selected more, a negative score means no has been selected more.  Polls can be set up by an 
administrator and all users can interact with the polls.

Blogging â€“ An index page lists all published posts.  The user can click on a post title to get to a page containing that post.  
Currently, only the administrator can write and publish posts on the app.  However, all users can view the index page and 
click on individual posts.


Note:  The code in the polling app was primarily given in the lectures leading up to the assignment as an example.  The framework 
for the blogging app and much of the code was also given in the lectures and students were asked to fill in the details.
